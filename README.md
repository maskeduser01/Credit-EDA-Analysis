Exploratory Data Analysis on Credit Dataset using Python


Credit Risk EDA Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
Financial institutions need to understand customer credit behavior to reduce loan defaults and financial risk.  
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key risk indicators that influence credit approval and default probability.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer credit-related information such as:

- Customer demographics
- Credit amount
- Loan duration
- Income details
- Employment status
- Credit history
- Default status (target variable)

The dataset is used to analyze risk patterns and understand factors affecting credit approval.
